#the matrix is this grid. 
#the circle is the 'i', yk like a for i in list()
#the + is something already checked.

#make a copy of the actuall file with but # instead of numbers.
#make a data set, with the number in the top left corner, and replace the top left thing in the file with a circle.
#basically the circle will take travel in a directon(following a priority list of orders ), as it moves it replaces the matrix with a circle, and the previous circle with a +, and then immeditatley importing the number the circle represents into the dataset, rinse and repeat.

#priority direction left, down, right, up.
